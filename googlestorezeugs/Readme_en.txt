Starting help:
- click on the path to open a filebrowser and go to the project location, you can click on the root of a project, it will find the correct files, if there's ambigouity, a dialog pops open to resolve it
- the first column of the tabl is the keyword, used in the code, a context menu by clicking on it allows to remove a whole line (beware no undo)
- a new keyword is created by clicking into the first column header, give in the dialog the type of the ressource, the token/keyword name, and a default value then hit ok
- klicking on the column header "..."you can un-hide loaded languages or add a new one
- clicking on a language column header hides that column.
- clicking on a field of a translation allows to change it, beware, no chekcing about the validity of your xml syntax is done... validate the value bit hitting enter, otherwise the data is not taken over!
