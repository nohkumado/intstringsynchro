# intstringsynchro
A small android helper to keep the string.xml ressources in sync 
between translations

at the moment i found 2 projects that try to chaieve this, but both are 
directed to commercial translators, who want to translate the stuff 
that wasn't translated, want time accounting and that sort of stuff...

as a dev, i just want a table with the available tokens and see where a
translation is missing...

just starting BTW...
